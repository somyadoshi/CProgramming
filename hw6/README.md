Memory manager implemenmtes the mallocing system in C programming language.
Getmem does malloc, freemem does free, and all other functions get the malloc stats and print the freelist into files.
Bench program simulates the process of calling malloc and free, and check the heap as well.
The overall purpose of this lab is getting to know the memoery management system in C. 
The structure we use to keep the free blocks is a single linked list.
